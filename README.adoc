= Introduction
Publishes the Antora `tech-notes` docs over Github Pages.
This content is found in https://github.com/TheMuskeeters/mktrs-antora-tech-notes[The Musketeers Tech Notes Repository,window=_blank]

AS you can see, there is a folder named *docs* which actually contains the site
contents. They are a simple copy of the *Antora* generated buld, but this Github
repository uses the *Github Pages* to serve the static pages.

In order to server files you must go to the repository *_Settings_* and have it set up as follows.

Locate in the left page the link _*Pages*_, as *Github Pages* is not enabled by default, it will show as

.Github Pages Config Home
image::resources/0001-githubpages-config-setup.png[Github Pages Config Home,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Then you must select the branch and folder where the content is published. 

.Github Pages Config Home Branch Selection

After you have selected the requested data, click the _*Save*_ button to enable the deployment of content to *Github Pages* host.

You receive a confirmation of the action as shown next.
